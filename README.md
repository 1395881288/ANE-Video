Air Native Extension for playing videos (iOS + Android)
======================================

This is an [Air native extension](http://www.adobe.com/devnet/air/native-extensions-for-air.html) for playing videos on iOS and Android. It has been developed by [FreshPlanet](http://freshplanet.com) and is used in the game [SongPop](http://songpop.fm).


Installation
---------

The ANE binary (AirVideo.ane) is located in the *bin* folder. You should add it to your application project's Build Path and make sure to package it with your app (more information [here](http://help.adobe.com/en_US/air/build/WS597e5dadb9cc1e0253f7d2fc1311b491071-8000.html)).


Usage
---------

Currently, this ANE can only play video files from URLs. You can find the Actionscript documentation in *actionscript/src/com/freshplanet/ane/AirVideo/AirVideo.as* and an example code in *test/src/AirVideoTest.mxml*.


Build script
---------

Should you need to edit the extension source code and/or recompile it, you will find an ant build script (build.xml) in the *build* folder:

    cd /path/to/the/ane/build
    mv example.build.config build.config
    #edit the build.config file to provide your machine-specific paths
    ant
